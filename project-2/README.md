## Introduction

For data analysis, I picked up and selected the TMDb movie dataset. This dataset is required to carry out all of the Data Anaysis's technique and its methodology and it consists of information from The Movie Database (TMDb) regarding 10,000 movies, including user reviews and revenue. Also, there is often too much information available to make a clear decision. that is why I have chosen to search for more interesting trends in the results.  

### Strategical plan 
 1. Clean up the data after previewing it. 
    - Delete any information that isn't relevant to the analysis.  
    - Check and validate for null values and duplicated values.
    - Converting any data types which is not suitable for the Data Analysis. <br><br>
 2. Investigate the data and outline to findings
    - find useful facts, look at the statistics methedology. 
    - Group and filter certain data to find important patterns
    - look at the numbers, trends, and data and come to new conclusions based on the findings.
    - Illustrate the findings, plot the above data and construct a visualisation.
    - present the data findings or translate the data into an understandable document.
