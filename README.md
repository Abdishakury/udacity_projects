## Here are three projects using Github - Version Control

- Project 1 : Exploring Weather Trends
- Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data)
- Project 3 : Analyze A/B Test Results

## Overview

This program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I have done
developed proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I have built a portfolio of projects to showcase in my job search.
Depending on how quickly I have work through the material, the amount of time required has been variable. I have included an hourly estimation for each section of the program. The program have covered one term of three
month (approx. 13 weeks). If I have spend about 10 hours per week working through the program, I should finish the term within 13 weeks. Students will have an additional four weeks beyond the end of the term to
complete all projects.
In order to succeed in this program, I recommend having experience working with data in Python (Numpy and Pandas) and SQL.

## Project 1 : Exploring Weather Trends
This project introduced me to the SQL and how to download data from a database. I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I have lived to overall global 
temperature trends.

## Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data)
In this project, I have chosen one of Udacityâ€™s curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I have completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by
sharing your findings.

## Project 3 : Analyze A/B Test Results
In this project, I have been provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I have used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and
recommendations in a report
